        Need a nav section where we'll have a form that is displayed in the upper right hand corner
        Beneate that there should be an unordered list section
            -- On initial page load, fill the page with random movies
                -- Within each movie li, need the image of the movie, movie title, movie rating, and the overview of the movie
        
        When a user searches for a keyword, need to reach out to the API with the keyword and get back a list of new movies
            -- Will need to wipe clear whatever movies are currently on the page and replace with movies from the response we get back
                -- For each page load, only populate the first 15 movies from the response
